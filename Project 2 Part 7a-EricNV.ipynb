The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible.

Now, I don\\'t think it\\'s asking too much of the audience to pretend that the characters are speaking Spanish among themselves even as the actors deliver their lines in English; after all Hemingway did something similar in For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the characters are supposed to be speaking in their native language, shouldn’t they sound like native speakers? Also, the dialogue should be consistent; i.e., all English all the time – because otherwise, what language are they supposed to be speaking when they say something in Spanish?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a Spanish film, about Spanish-speaking characters, written, produced and directed by Spaniards; why they felt the need to tell their story in any other language than that of Cervantes, I haven’t the foggiest. Except, of course, for the obvious reason of appealing to the Anglo-Saxon market, but in this case why go to the trouble of getting Spanish – especially big names like Bardem and Cruz – and Colombians actors, only to force them to recite most of their dialogue in English?

Classmate David (Alex Pettyfer) has had a crush on Jade throughout high school, but never acted on it. A chance meeting between the two sets in motion a deep summer love, much to the disapproval of Jade's father (Bruce Greenwood), who determines David to be a bad influence on his daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime is a valuable asset in filmmaking, especially when setting the scene for a movie. Back stories must be set out, and then fleshed out, so that it's clear what drives the characters to make the choices they do. _Endless Love_ doesn't feel the need to worry the audience with any of that, starting on Graduation Day with two protagonists who it is admitted have never spoken to each other, and having them fall straight in love.\\r\\n\\r\\nJade, who has precious few friends, implying her classmates know very little about her personality, is idolised by David, presumably for being a blonde bombshell. When given the smallest amount of attention from David, Jade then is willing to drop everything that her father has coerced her into working for.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Daddy shows his disapproval, because he projects expectations of Jade's dead brother onto her, Jade becomes little more than a pawn between her father and David. While Jade's mother appears to be softer towards the relationship, her viewpoint is completely undermined when we learn that her husband is cheating on her (a plot point that seemingly is to further the animosity between David and Jade's father, but becomes completely forgotten about later on).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acting is passable, but when working with a cardboard screenplay there is very little point.\\r\\n\\r\\nEndless Love is the worst type of film. Promoting itself as a young woman's choice to leave the clutches of her evil father is both disingenuous, dangerous and damaging to the young women it is aimed at.

Yeah, it’s that kind of bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the action scenes fall victim to rapid-fire editing that is intended to disguise the bloodless PG-13 action flick. There’s an almost-satisfying extended fight sequence involving elevators and a skyscraper, but it comes late in the film when most audiences will likely have already lost interest. Even worse, there are no consequences because Ray can’t be hurt or killed, and the special effects look like they were created in a couple of hours by a pre-teen boy on the family room laptop.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiesel is not a great actor, but that’s never been a job requirement to bring the charismatic, cinematic muscle to the big screen. He’s a perfectly acceptable action star, but here he turns in a laughably bad performance. His poor acting hogs the spotlight, especially when he shares scenes opposite the talented Pearce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis movie is absolute junk that will die a quick death at the box office. Please, audiences: do your part to put “Bloodshot” out of its misery.',\n",
       "       \"**Norm of the no worth!**\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely my review would annoy those who liked it. But the majority of who saw it was felt just like me. It has been 20 years since the first 3D animated feature film came. Not all the films released in this period were great. Some were technically sounded good and some were stories. If you had seen 'Hoodwinked!', you would know how awesome that story was, despite the poor animation production. But this film failed in all the department.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recently finished watching the first season of 'Trollhunters' and 'Miraculous Ladybug'. Even the television made products were much better than this film. Small budget, small production house et cetera is not an excuse. Thankfully, this is not the only bad animated feature I've seen so far in my life, but sadly it joins the list of those titles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe! The little kids could enjoy it, who does not know to differentiate between good and bad. But for the adults, this is definitely skippable film. The best thing about this film was the message it carried, though, even for an animated film and a fantasy film, not convincing enough. It was kind of very similar to 'Delhi Safari'. In some perspective, I thought it was a remake of that. There are lots of other films similar to this like 'Chole & Theo', 'Happy Feet' and so on that you can try them instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n_2/10_\",\n",

He really tried, but it was so boring movie in the recent time I have seen one. Pardon me to mock him, but I had to say that the film looks like the one what Willem Dafoe trying to make one in 'Mr. Bean's Holiday'.

But I liked 'Tammy' better, not this one and there will be one more film that I hope they would come up with much more interesting than these two.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is not a solo type star, her films are always the multistarrer. So whenever I hear about her new films, I get curious about her new partner. Kristen Bell was not bad, even Peter Dinklage have given a nice performance. So The casting was good, but they all did not get the good script or the role. I did not enjoy it means not that I won't recommend it.

       "       \"> An unnecessary follow up! Foolander!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. Ben Stiller is a good actor, but a fine filmmaker, His directional ventures were awesome, especially after his last film 'Walter Mitty' the expectation was very high on this, but I did not think it'll end like this. It hits the rock bottom, the lowest point in his directional career. His odd film experiment had failed, just for one project and I know he will come back strong. But as an actor, he still got the star value and I'm looking forward for his upcoming project.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been 15 years since the original film and I don't remember much of it. But before this, I had a very quick re-view, so I'm to get a clean flow for a better understanding. Anyway, the film gave a brief report about the past events in the beginning, but when I saw the first face in the opening scene I knew it will going to suck and it did.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, the first, the story was decent, but not the jokes. And the next, there are too many cameos that kind of ruined its pace to keep quiet for sometime and to focus on actual story development. From all those, the best part and where I actually had a brief laugh was to see Neil deGrasse Tyson. The second films are always very crucial, because it is a bridge between the original film and numerous follow-ups to set up a franchise status. So clearly this film stumbled and I don't think there will be any more films in this series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 'Zoolander' had its own brand appeal, but with this bad film it got lost. The production was very good and so the performances, but the humours were average. No offense, there are some people who still liked it, but I did not, so I won't recommend it for the 'Zoolander' fans as well as if you're looking for a good comedy. But like I always say who knows you might like it, so think twice in which one is if you're reading this review and the second is analyse it before to decide anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n3/10\",\n",

The biggest problems are simply that the lead actor just is not charismatic enough for the role:  the character can still be a wimp and likeable enough for the audience to be behind him from the start.  The second problem, which probably hurts the lead, is that the \"best friend\" character has too big a personality and is gratuitously stupid far beyond the point of irritation.  There are several points where the movie stops just so we can watch him be a moron.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s all about pacing.

Robert Downey Jr. is of course the lead, but there are also notable appearances from the likes of Antonio Banderas, Michael Sheen and Jim Broadbent - as well as voice roles for the likes of Emma Thompson, Rami Malek and Octavia Spencer.

However, one may question whether the complexity of the film is worth sacrificing entertainment value. In attempting to weave together these complex themes, Ari Aster has created a narrative that was very difficult for me to fully process.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first hour of the movie, I found myself engrossed in the story, with tense scenes that blurred the lines between what is real and what is fake. However, as the film progressed, these surreal scenes became increasingly wild and disjointed, leaving me feeling disconnected from the narrative. I found myself constantly asking questions about what was happening, how we got there, and why things were unfolding the way they were. This detachment ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three hours in length, Beau is Afraid can be a daunting task for audiences to undertake. While a well-paced film can fly by (Avatar: The Way of Water and Babylon for instance), this one felt like a slog at times, and I found myself frequently checking the clock to see how much time was left. However, despite these shortcomings, the technical execution of the film was truly exceptional. Aster's direction was brilliant, with stunning camera work and beautiful cinematography. The acting was also top-notch, with Joaquin Phoenix delivering what was arguably the best performance of the year so far. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Patti LuPone, and Nathan Lane, also gave standout performances.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, Beau is Afraid was quite a letdown for me.

With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy.

Therefore, I couldn\\'t help but feel incredibly excited about another installment set in the same world. It\\'s not a direct sequel to the original\\'s story, but it seems to be placed just after the pandemic began. Unfortunately, it ends up being a huge disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the jaw-dropping stunt work and the extremely intense action sequences, the reason why Peninsula\\'s predecessor works so well is due to its focus on the characters. By giving them a compelling development and a strong emotional bond, the zombie outbreak becomes instantly more effective because of our immense concern for everyone involved. Every technical element is dialed up to its maximum, transforming the film into an emotionally devastating, heart-wrenching story.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeon Sang-ho tries to follow a shortcut to achieve that same emotion of his previous movie, dooming this \"sequel\" from the very beginning. Every relationship feels forced, and the supposedly heartbreaking decisions/events are a complete target miss. Even the action scenes fail to live up to the original\\'s level due to excessive CGI in ridiculous car chases. Every fifteen minutes, a major logical issue arises, and some characters are either straight-up dumb or unbelievably smart for their age/experience. Peninsula takes the realistic environment established by Train to Busan and fictionalizes it way too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: C-',\n",

I think Zack Snyder crushed it with the incredible production design, off-the-charts casting, and gritty take on a lost and weary Batman. The casting for this movie is a master stroke of brilliance. Ben Affleck’s Batman is jaded and bitter, taking his rage and loss out on the criminal element of Gotham. His hulking physique emphasizes Batman’s imposing strength over his gadgets when in combat. Zack Snyder also gave us Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, which we all know is one of the best choices in the comic book cinema world. The fight sequences are the best part of BvS; pitting godlike power against a man motivated by grief somehow seems possible and brutal because of Snyder’s writing and directing. Finally, the world-building and teases bring so much intrigue and excitement for future films.

It follows a family through a twelve year period as they endure situations and tackle obstacles together. The main technical aspect of the film is a very controversial and memorable one as Linklater hired his main actors and continued to follow them for twelve years thus adding to the realism of the feature adding much poignancy to the themes. The overall direction can be considered very naturalistic and simple but there are wonderful shots of natural environments such as the beautiful river that Mason and his father visit representing the beauty of life whilst underlining the insignificance of man's role in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screenplay is a touching study of the meaning of life. There is a great balance of humour and heart-rending dialogue throughout the film. At 165 minutes, the movie is a long one but the pacing was perfect and captivating that I hardly noted the film's duration. The characters each have profound dialogue in which they discuss the journey of which they (and we) are going through and question the reasoning of difficult events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances in 'Boyhood' are exceptional. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) starts off as relatively inexperienced and under-developed but matures as the film progresses adding substance to his character's arch. This performance is supported by the excellent Patricia Arquette who plays the mother. Arquette manages to portray the mother perfectly as she undergoes traumatic events that shape her family's life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I feel that 'Boyhood' is a technically brilliant achievement in film-making.

One of Disney's best live-action offerings up until 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's yet another sports drama from the studio, one of many still to come too, but it's a cut above their previous live-actions releases in this subgenre; even beating 2002's <em>'The Rookie'</em>, which I like tremendously.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love every detail of <em>'The Greatest Game Ever Played'</em>, which is about a true story. The score is splendid, the cinematography is excellent and the premise is riveting - even to someone like me who isn't a follower of golf. There are a few scenes that use effects, namely with Vardon, which look neat.\\r\\n\\r\\nVardon is portrayed by Stephen Dillane, who is terrific in the role. Stephen Marcus plays Ted Ray, he's another top performer as is Josh Flitter (Eddie) - the latter brings some amusing humour to events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film's star, however, is Shia LaBeouf. He does a grand job as Ouimet, he produces the goods in all of his scenes. I'm already a fan of LaBeouf's, so I'm glad I can add another one of his characters to my memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not feel like a 120 minute production. Great pacing, great film. Highly recommended!\",\n",
       "       \"I literally liked the Movie. Its story is outstanding and innovative. However, I wish the ending was more of action scenes than dialogues. \\r\\nNot to forget that Javier Barden's acting is breathtaking and marvelous. His smile 4:49 is petrifying!\",\n",

The acting was superb in this movie all around. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances of his career. Jonah Hill and Margo Robbie were fantastic! For a movie that was almost three hours, it flew by and was incredibly engaging. I can not believe it took me this long to see it.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Score:** _90%_\\r\\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_\",\n",

What a great choice it was!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the entire film is in real time, meaning we watch the event as they unfold in real time, makes it a true edge-of-the-seat stuff. Acting was nothing to brag about but the story was great. As you watch it, you keep finding yourself arguing with yourself, trying to decide what you would actually do if you were one of the characters in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re looking for something to watch and have access to this film, don’t even think for a second and press that play button.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould I watch it again?

The first that begins with an actual explanation of what created the zombie plague. \\r\\n2. The first to introduce a fast-moving \"infected\" horde, ratching up the tension significantly. \\r\\n3. The first to infect people instantly (within seconds). \\r\\n\\r\\nIt also has one of the best movie scores, one that rivals those from John Carpenter classics \"Halloween\" and \"The Thing.\" It is striking how the music can elevate a movie or a scene. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest issue, which to be fair, is not something Danny Boyle and his crew could have foreseen, is that it was shot in low quality SD, making it nearly unwatchable on large screen modern HD or 4K TV\\'s.',\n",

I know I over-rate Anderson films but it's because I highly enjoy both his visual sensibility and the quirky style of humanistic humour that's pervasive in his work.

       "       \"I don't love <em>'Toy Story 3'</em> as much as its two predecessors. That doesn't mean that it isn't anything other than great though.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy the bountiful humour and intriguing plot, while the newly-introduced toys are very good. If I had to nitpick, I don't massively like Lotso, who kinda feels to me like a slight copy of The Prospector from the 1999 sequel - with the difference here being he's the ultimate antagonist, perhaps too villainous for my own personal taste. As I said though, just a tiny criticism in the grand scheme of these productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom Hanks remains on top form as Woody, as do all the others including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack). Ned Beatty does a terrific job as Lotso, while Barbie and Ken are brought to life well by Jodi Benson and Michael Keaton.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again there are some excellent scenes, with the ending also being entertaining just like in <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. There's also a lot of heart in the concluding scene. I'm surprised they did a fourth time, even if I do agree it's still a very good new instalment.\\r\\n\\r\\nPixar and Disney keep up a pretty remarkable high quality, even in the third film of the franchise. I will never tire watching these.\",\n",
       "       \"> One of the finest movie about the raids on cartel gangs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was really a great film. Fighting against the drug trafficking was the theme. The story of an FBI agent who was recruited to work in an elite force that no one knows its existence. Their's aim is to tackle the main source, instead to deal with its lower order. Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. Like I said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. No doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first. One of the best movie of the year, so definitely recommended if you're interested.\\r\\n\\r\\n8½/10\",\n",

This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is \"adoption of a strange child\" trope, there is a \"troubled couple\" trope, there is even a mystery trope.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they\\'re going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different \"Twilight Zone\" episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through.',\n",

That's despite me having little to no knowledge of N.W.A, I knew of their name and of Ice Cube and Dr. Dre but basically zilch about their actual story. I couldn't comment on how true it is to history, but as a film it's fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have great performances from O'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell and Paul Giamatti. Mitchell impressed me most as Eazy-E, while the casting of Jackson as Ice Cube - his father, of course - was a masterstroke. All the cast do very well, in truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love how gritty the film is too, it feels real - at least as real as film can get. There is some neat cinematography in there, while the music is entwinned nicely. The pacing is almost perfect, aside from a few moments in the middle. I also rate how it all ends, in terms of the story but also with the end credits. There's heart in there.\",\n",
       "       '**Dodgeball knows it’s a ludicrous nonsensical laugh fest and embraces all its ridiculous charm to become one of the best sports comedies of all time.**\\r\\n\\r\\nDodgeball is one of the funniest, most outrageous movies in existence and is one of my favorite comedies (and sports movies?) of all time! This movie just had every actor in their sweet spot. White Goodman is peak Ben Stiller. Vaughn, Long, and Taylor each feel at home in their roles, and Alan Tudyk’s Steve the Pirate steals the scene every time. Each and every moment of this movie is zany, goofy, and insane, making Dodgeball a quintessential 2000s comedy. Dodgeball gifts the world with hilarious lines to be quoted repeatedly, Chuck Norris gifs, and laughs that keep going long after the movie ends. Plenty of people might disagree, but Dodgeball will forever be one of the best movies of the 2000s and maybe eternity… ok, let’s stick with the 2000s.',\n",
       "       \"Alongside _Weekend_ and _Moonlight_, _Call Me By Your Name_ is the greatest queer film I have seen in the past ten years. It's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - Luca Guadagnino has given us something truly special here. I'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. The fact that the legendary James Ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timothée Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls. Chalamet does the same thing here and it's overwhelmingly stunning.\",\n",
       "       \"A fun one!\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a terrific time watching <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'</em>, despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nStar of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em>, but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.\",\n",
       "       '_**A boy coming-of-age near Cape Cod and more**_  \\r\\n\\r\\nA 14 year-old boy (Liam James) struggles to fit-in with the family & friends of his mother’s new beau (Steve Carell) as they partake of a vacation at his beach house in the Cape Cod area. The teen finds a quasi-mentor (Sam Rockwell) at a water park while developing a friendship with the cute neighbor girl (AnnaSophia Robb). Toni Collette plays the mother, Allison Janney a friend and Amanda Peet a flirty woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Way Way Back” (2013) is a coming-of-age flick that meshes elements of films like \"The Squid and the Whale\" (2005), “The Summer of ’42” (1971), “Meatballs” (1979), “Swimming” (2000) and “Lawn Dogs” (1997), but this is arguably the best of them. \\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the genius of the movie is that the potential stepfather (Carell) isn’t made out to be totally evil nor is the seeming mentor (Rockwell) perfect. They’re both flawed men with presumably good intentions toward the boy, but only one proves that he’s a worthy father-figure. Moreover, the all-around writing/acting smacks of real life.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnaSophia is super cute on the female front while Zoe Levin is alluring as the pouty, bratty stepsister. Meanwhile Andria Blackman has a standout cameo as the girl in a yellow bikini.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in the Cape Code region of Massachusetts: Wareham & nearby Onset; Marshfield & nearby Duxbury.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: A/A-',\n",
       "       \"A thoroughly entertaining 157 minutes!\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>'American Gangster'</em> delivers in every area it needs to. Enthralling premise, immaculate music, phenomenal casting and great pacing. I was surprised slightly with how it finishes, but it's far and away from a disappointing/underwhelming conclusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot much really needs to be said about Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. They're exactly how you'd expect them to be, outstanding! Washington is fantastic as Frank, while Crowe is superb as Richie. You have to wait a while for their proper screen time together, but it's worth the time it takes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from the leads, you have a load of recognizable faces - I was literally that Rick Dalton meme for the first 45-60 mins! Chiwetel Ejiofor (Huey) and Josh Brolin (Trupo) have sizeable roles, though there's also appearances from Carla Gugino (Laurie), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Nicky), Idris Elba (Tango) and Norman Reedus (Norman). Excellent casting, that!\\r\\n\\r\\nI was expecting slow moments due to the run time, but there aren't any - at least in my opinion. As noted, the way it ends is a tad differently to how I would've predicted, but I still enjoyed it alongside the rest of the it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might not be accurate on the real life Frank Lucas, but all that truly matters is does it excel as a film? Yes it does. Highly recommend!\",\n",
       "       'I don’t have that much to say about “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” except that it’s easily one of the best films of the year. It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy: Louisa Moore',\n",

The story of a freelance accountant who was hired by a company to find the financial frauds. But when he's on the verge to uncover the names, the company rolls back over one of its member's death in the following day. It does not stop there, the life threat tails him and all who were involved with him. Now the film reveals his real identity going back to disclose his childhood days, like how he grew up. In the meantime, he has to find those people who are after him before they do and so with a twist the film comes to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing from a DC film, now Ben Affleck proved he can be like any other top actors from the industry. His physique was great for the role he played. Thanks to Batman role. This is like his version of 'John Wick' or 'Jack Reacher'. Definitely we can expect a sequel here. Anna Kedrick was great in the recent time with all her films, particularly the box office wise. In this she did not get bigger role, but one of the main and in the follow-up, she might get more opportunity. The film was almost perfect for a crime-thriller.

There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him.\\r\\n\\r\\nElsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me.

       "       \"John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\\r\\n\\r\\nScore: 93%\\r\\nVerdict: Excellent\",\n",
       "       'This movie is really awesome. It took me two viewings to truly cement the way I truly feel about this film. But upon second viewing this film was not just an entertaining blast from start to finish but to be honest a perfect conclusion to the Skywalker story. The film traverses the stories of the previous films in order to bring all those stories together for a culmination that is truly satisfying. The cinematography and visual effects as usual are outstanding in the film but this film seems to have a unique feel that adds to the foreboding tone kept consistent throughout. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley as Rey and Kylo truly shine in this film and are both giving their a - game and prove that they are both incredible actors and extremely emotionally flexible (particularly Ridley). The Arc of Kylo Ren is by far the highlight of this trilogy and in this film and the conclusion of said arc is immensely satisfying, Reys story also takes a surprising turn which I found immensely satisfying in hindsight. As a conclusion to my favourite series of all time I was left immensely pleased with the final sequence of the film which brings all of this lore together in a way I couldn’t predict to be this poignant. This film overall was a wonderful farewell to this saga that was so satisfying and enjoyable that I will look back on this saga with great nostalgia and adoration that I hope to show my children as a whole nine part saga and I am immensely honoured to have been part of this moment in pop culture and to get to view this conclusion is a truly wonderful thing for me. It’s with this i farewell the galaxy far far away with immense satisfaction.',\n",

I am thinking especially of The Girl in the Cafe, where he oddly enough also plays a civil servant.\\r\\n\\r\\nNighy is wonderful and methodical (in a good way) as a man who is thawing out from a repetitious, paralyzed life after he receives life-altering news. He even impresses when he sings a song in the same quiet, restrained manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nA flashback is applied in an odd way nearer the end of the movie, but it works as an imaginative way to fill in the details of the ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fully expect to watch this again.',\n",

Blanca Portillo makes her presence felt, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story is paced expertly, with the two hour run time flying by. It is quite the plot, with things of substance happening from practically the first first minutes. I really enjoyed seeing it all unfold.

       "       'If you like old-fashioned James Bond style movies you probably like this one. It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.\\r\\n\\r\\nGary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.\\r\\n\\r\\nGary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallell. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movie has all the “goodies” of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent “stuff” like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind’s nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so than the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes.

Nominated for Costume Design, but I expected the Best Actor, Actress, and particularly Original Screenplay and Motion Picture. This amazing spy thriller-drama was directed by Robert Zemeckis of many popular flicks. The best casting in the recent films and visually so good of those 40s atmosphere, like it be the war or the society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the story of two spies from different nation who meet in Casablanca for a mission. Pretending to be a newly wed couple, soon they enter the real wedlock. The rest of the tale follows a couple of years later when a big question arises, in that they have to prove their innocence. Failing it could lead them to a serious consequence. So the narration filled with suspense and thriller takes over with a greater pace till the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously the film was long, but I did not mind or I could say I did not know how the two hours went on so quickly. Engaging plot kept me my focus on the screen. As we know, all these years the Oscars turned down the best performance recognitions, including this one for Brad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore going to watch this film, I thought it was another World War II film which might be inspired by the real. But it was not. Takes place in the background of the same war, but this is a spy film. And their personal life and profession, how one another influences is what revealed. Now I don't know when such kind of a great spy thriller I'm going to watch next. I think it is massively underrated, especially stupid film critics and their takes on it was unbelievably wrong. I surely, highly recommend it.\\r\\n\\r\\n_9/10_\",\n",

Instead, these kind farmers and mild-mannered townspeople become emotionless and murderous killers using whatever weapons they can find to expedite the slaughter. The suspense starts slow in the early minutes of the film but consistently builds to a fevered anxiety as the military attempts to quarantine the outbreak trapping the survivors inside with the crazed infected. Timothy Olyphant’s performance as the local sheriff trying to keep his family alive against a town of former friends and neighbors turned insane murderers is outstanding and genuine. The Crazies cast does an excellent job building buy-in and investment in their characters, making the audience actually care when one meets their brutal fate.

However, to my surprise it\\'s the exact opposite to all that.

Joey King was the only character I wasn\\'t sold on during the film, though by the end I dug her performance too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada are also very good, while Michael Shannon, Benito A. Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) and Zazie Beetz are welcomed cast members as well. There are also a few other noteworthy people involved, including two that Pitt knows well from a different <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2022 flick</a>. Seriously, what a cast!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had to mention one gripe, it would be the run time/pacing - this is me nit-picking, though at like one or two (no more than that) moments I did feel like it wasn\\'t paced incredibly.

Aaron Eckhart (Jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like Anna Gunn (Elizabeth) and Michael Rapaport (Pete).

I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film. His character\\'s lines in this are nuts and his delivery with them is incredible - the look of utter disgust on Walt Kowalski\\'s face when someone pisses him off in a new way is just amusing to watch.

Much like Andrea Arnold's masterpiece from last year, _American Honey_, this film brings to light many issues that are insanely topical in the current American political climate such as classism and racism.\\r\\n\\r\\nGorgeously shot on 35mm, this film is a feast for the eyes. It uses every colour in the crayon box from the gloriously purple exterior to the dilapidated Magic Kingdom motel to the impossibly bright oranges, reds, and greens of the local shops where the kids venture every day. While plasticky and candy-like during the day scenes, the film is even more stunning at sundown - the dusty, sun-drenched shots here are sublime.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone has been abuzz about Willem Dafoe's performance in this. He's absolutely charming and is the glue that holds these dejected people's lives together in this film. He's the father figure to all of them and he does the absolute most with his character. The breakthrough star of this film, however, is 7-year-old Brooklynn Prince. She's an absolute superstar. During the Q&A at the North American premiere she wore a baby blue princess gown and simultaneously waved like Queen Elizabeth II and blew kisses at the audience as they gave her a standing ovation.

       "       '***Evils of the past and the problems with vigilante justice***\\r\\n\\r\\nReleased in 2003 and directed by Clint Eastwood, “Mystic River” tells the story of three men from a working class neighborhood in Boston. While playing in the street as kids, one of them is abducted and sexually abused for days. As adults they’ve drifted apart. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a reformed con who runs a successful market when his daughter is suddenly murdered (Emmy Rossum). Sean (Kevin Bacon) investigates the murder with his partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), with evidence eventually pointing toward Dave (Timothy Bottoms), the one who was abducted. Marcia Gay Harden plays Dave’s anxious spouse while Laura Linney plays Jimmy’s loyal wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is similar in tone & theme to the melancholy “Sleepers” (1996), but less episodic and more dramatically gripping. The movie has the confidence to take its time and flesh-out the characters. It’s a psychological crime drama that works as both a whodunit and a tragedy. The intrinsic problems of vigilante justice are cogently illustrated.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people have misinterpreted the movie because they missed some things. For instance, they criticize the curious Lady Macbeth-like monologue of Annabeth (Linney) at the end. But watch the movie again, pay close attention, and the answers are there. I’d say more, but I don’t want to give anything away (you’re welcome to write me if you’d like some insights). \\r\\n\\r\\n“Mystic River” is not something that can be casually watched; it’s a deep drama with three-dimensional characters, potently exploring several intriguing issues: How abuses of the past affect the present; the danger of hiding recesses of your psyche; the folly of not getting spiritual help for deep-rooted psychological concerns; disloyalty/loyalty; doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; jumping to wrong conclusions based on dubious info; houses divided cannot stand; the importance of encouraging one’s spouse for the sake of familial health & survival; “king of the castle”; etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot in Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: A',\n",

Almost the entirety of the trailer was just the first act, and it left me seriously stumped at where this movie was going.\\r\\nThat sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. There is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. You never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. Not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the acting was brilliant. Georgina Campbell was fantastic. Bill Skarsgård was a bit awkward at times, but I do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. Justin Long stole the show. His character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.\\r\\nThe movie does slightly fall of the rails in the third act, it does not take away from the experience that is Barbarian.

Still I watched this, largely due to the involvement of several favorite actors and the script having been written by the Duplass brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found it almost instantly both funny and moving, and the longer I watched, the more confused I became as to why most critics had been lukewarm or downright dismissive of it.

Critics in general can\\'t stand it.

Was it realistic that most of the people involved got a happy, somewhat romantic ending? Of course not, but though the movie tackles several \\'real\\' issues within the comedy, I found the ending perfectly fitting with the tone of it.

In all the games, she always killed the foes just to survive and the balance was just right here, with Alicia Vikander lending just the right amount of steely determination to the role.\\r\\nMore importantly, I could relate to the film having played all the games - the plane on top of the waterfall, the rolling spikes and the collapsing floor later on - all drew me in wonderfully.\\r\\nI'll take two please, or preferably three!\",\n",
       "       \"This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen in a long time. I understand why some people might not fully appreciate the story (which reminds me of Aronofsky's Black Swan in that it's a painfully slow descent into Hell). I find this film as complex as a fine scotch, or a fine wine. The top note is, of course, the beautiful visuals created by Ben Davis. The acting all around is phenomenal. Farrell and Gleeson were, of course, nothing short of spectacular. The real surprise was the character created by Barry Keoghan. I couldn't help but be amazed by how real his character was. Although I was expecting the banshees to be like in the horror film I saw as a kid, I really appreciated the Shakespearean witch device. It was perfect in this context. The second note of flavor of this masterpiece is all about relationships in a closed community. If you ever lived in a condo, an association community or the like, you will recognize the day-to-day pettiness that everyone thinks is so important. A subtle addition to the complex layers of flavor is Burwell's perfect score. And the deep flavor of this movie? It is the parallel that the protagonists finally draw to the meaninglessness of the Civil War that rages on the mainland. If two people within a single tribe cannot make a peace, how is this poor world ever going to live?\",\n",

Even the terror of running into your ex-girlfriend and current sugar daddy at a shiva.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s the general plot of Emma Seligman’s impressive debut, _Shiva Baby_. The movie begins with college senior Danielle (Rachel Sennott) waking up in her sugar daddy Max’s (Danny Deferrari) apartment. She’s running late to a shiva (we don’t ever find out who died) where she meets her parents (Fred Melamed and Polly Draper). Among the other guests are her ex-girlfriend Maya (Molly Gordon), Max, Max’s wife (Dianna Agron), and their infant child. Danielle sees all of these people in the same room, and her anxiety skyrockets. The movie takes place over the course of about two fictional hours, and the action occurs almost entirely in one home. It is a brisk 78 minutes, and that’s a perfect runtime. Another moment of this familial, heart-racing anxiety would have been too much for the audience to handle.',\n",

And Based on my criteria, this movie is 10/10! This movie actually traumatized me. I have seen a lot of horror movies, but this one affected me a lot, because unlike those paranormal movies about demons, devil and etc, this one is realistic, which means this what happened in this movie, might be happening in real somewhere. And when we - viewers watch movies, we feel for main characters and what I felt for them in this movie was very big pain. It left me very angry and whole night I had last scenes in my mind when I was lying in bed, because I was imagining what if I was in their place...

Trainspotting was one of those \"how the hell did they make this book into a coherent movie\" movies and in many aspects \"Porno\" would have been easier, but would certainly still fit into that mold. So it\\'s likely better that T2 didn\\'t follow the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, the joy is just seeing the crew back together again, the chemistry is still there, it\\'s totally an ensemble cast and that was really the principal draw to the first film as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t want to give away the plot, but the cast just works so well together, they know their characters and live them. And the characters are delightful to watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sort of feel that they could have thrown any script at them, and so long as the cast and characters stayed the same...the film would have been thoroughly entertaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t hit as hard as the first film, but everyone has aged and it\\'s still....brilliant.\\r\\n\\r\\nReally, you\\'re watching it for the cast and characters, and it pays off in sheer entertainment.',\n",

Marvel seems to break its villain curse with Klau and especially Killmonger. Killmonger is very well developed and even sympathetic at times, despite his villainy.

Few romance movies capture the totality of love, loss, and remembrance in the way Sciamma does in this film. The story is simple: Marianne (Noémie Merlant) has been hired to paint a portrait of Heloise (Adèle Haenel) to be sent to the Milanese nobleman she is to marry. He will not marry her until he sees what she looks like. Other artists have tried and failed to paint Heloise, but she has resisted because she doesn’t want to be married. Marianne pretends to be Heloise’s walking companion, all the while studying Heloise so she can paint her in secret. Eventually, though, Marianne’s secret is revealed and Heloise agrees to sit for her.',\n",

From the top class performances, the ace cinematography, the excellent music and, most importantly, the captivating plot. I enjoyed this more than (the great) <em>'Goodfellas'</em>, which is my only previous experience of a Martin Scorsese film.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert De Niro is always a fantastic watch and here he is no different, I absolutely loved every scene of him as Frank. Al Pacino (Jimmy) and Joe Pesci (Russell) are also superb, Pacino particularly. Away from those three, you also have Ray Romano, Bobby Cannavale, Stephen Graham and Harvey Keitel involved. Awesome cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo idea how true to life it is, all I care is if it delivers a fantastic film - and it undoubtedly does. I felt entertained for every second.

I was particularly impressed by Gong, she truly is terrific from beginning to end - as what is a memorable character. I know I say this a lot with actors, but I'm gonna need to try and check out more of her filmography!\\r\\n\\r\\nChow is the only actor in this that I'm familiar with, but this clearly tops what I've seen (not enough, granted) of him thus far - still a fan of him as Sao Feng in <em>'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'</em>, though. The rest of those onscreen, despite the commanding presence of the aforementioned, still manage to standout in my memory as well, from earlier noted Chen and Chou to Li Man to Liu Ye.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe costumes, the sets... I personally do not think this film really put a foot wrong in terms of how it's made. How about those battle sequences too? Visually stunning, but also audibly so. The ending didn't go the way I was expecting, which is very much a positive thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly, this film hit an unwritten cheat code for me. As in: Give me strong performances and a great score and I am hook, line, and sinker. This Zhang Yimou flick gave me that in abundance. Overall, in my opinion: top notch!\",\n",

Ghost Protocol ratchets up the action, the stunts, the comedy, and the allure while still delivering a compelling and entertaining story in ways the franchise hadn’t mastered before. The world of the IMF expands beyond its star agent Ethan Hunt by showing agents on other missions and giving Hunt’s team backstories and development. Brad Bird’s Pixar charm rubs off on the film with fun, quirky moments punctuating the incredible action set pieces and providing a little breathing room in the intense face-paced plot. The quality of new characters and the pedigree of the actors playing them seems to prepare the franchise for spin-offs or even a changing of the guard (if Tom Cruise ever wanted to pass the movies on to a new lead). Ghost Protocol sets a new bar for the Mission Impossible series that causes its successors to thrive as they reach for its level of excellence. If you didn’t want to watch all 6 (and soon to be 8), Ghost Protocol wouldn’t be a bad place to start.',\n",

The Lumiere brothers must be rolling in their graves at how cinema has been travestied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only regret other than my time wasted and the scar on my brain from having watched it is the fact that unlike Metacritic, on themoviedb.org I can't give it a zero rating.

These ambiguities are created only by the chaotic and crowded montage and a series of theoretical dialogues, and no cinema is seen in it. Also, we do not see any coherent story during the film and the events of the film do not form a script at all. There is no characterization in the film, the protagonist character is not made at all and is not believable, also the other characters are completely caricatured and extra, also during the film and its artificial communication, not a bit of feeling is created. Aside from the fact that the film does not even come close to form, it is also very beginner in terms of technique, excessive cuts, and sometimes weird and inappropriate! The opening and closing sequences of the film are highly artificial, and the final sequence is saturated with a large number of cuts, aerial shots and rudimentary special effects. The only slight positive aspect of the film is its acting, and the acting of the antagonist character is defensible. In general, the film is considered to be a very bad and weak film, which is like a puzzle without a pattern, meaning that after putting the white pieces together, which is not a difficult task, it has nothing to offer.\"],\n",
