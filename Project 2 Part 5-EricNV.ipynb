    "### <u>Overview:\n",
    "- This project is an extension of the movies porject from Enricment. This portion focuses on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a database of movie reviews.\n",
    "- Students will leverage NLP tools such as NLTK, Spacy, WordCloud, and Scikit-Learn to explore, analyze, and model text data. The ultimate goal is to establish a relationship between the textual content of the reviews and their associated ratings and subsequently predict these ratings."
